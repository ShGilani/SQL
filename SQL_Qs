Find the number of the orders above â‚¬1 000  (Significant Orders) using only the COUNT() function?

SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN order_price > 1000 THEN 1 END)
AS significant_orders
FROM orders;

Instead of putting conditions at the end of the query and filtering after the COUNT() function does its job, we can use the CASE statement. 

The COUNT() statement above reads as follows:

Find all the values in the column order_price above 1000.
Assign the value 1 (you can assign any value you want) to these values.
Assign NULL to rows with prices below 1000.
Count the number of assigned 1s.
Show the result in the column significant_orders.
