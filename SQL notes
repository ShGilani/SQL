COUNT(*) is same as COUNT(1)
SELECT COUNT(1) AS number_of_customers FROM orders; (Includes all the records in the result set including null)


SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers FROM orders; (doesn't count records with NULL customer_id)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers FROM orders;
